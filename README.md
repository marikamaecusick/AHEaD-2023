## Project description
What constitutes a fair or unfair algorithm is context specific. Metrics for evaluating fairness have been developed, as have methods for prioritizing measures of fairness when building algorithms. However, algorithms are not neutral and optimization choices will reflect a specific value system and the distribution of power to make these decisions. Data also reflect societal bias, such as structural racism. Algorithmic fairness research spans many fields, including sociology, ethics, computer science, statistics, and population health. These concepts are incredibly important given the potential for and actual realized harm to marginalized groups. This summer, students will have an opportunity to learn more about ethical pipelines for algorithms and contribute to an ongoing project in chronic kidney disease clinical decision-making. 

To make treatment decisions regarding chronic kidney disease (CKD), providers are reliant on a clinical algorithm, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) formula to gauge severity of CKD. Prior to 2021, different versions of the eGFR formula included a race-based adjustment, which was disproven to have clinical justification and potentially exacerbated racial disparities. 

On December 1st, 2021, Stanford Health Care (SHC) implemented a new version of the eGFR formula (CKD-EPI 2021) that no longer has a race adjustment. During the summer, students will help determine which population groups at SHC were the most impacted by the eGFR formula change. 

## Week 1 (June 26 - June 30)

#### *Literature review: what is the eGFR formula?*

During the first week, youu will read about CKD and how the eGFR formula defines severity of disease. 

**Readings**:
- [Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/about-chronic-kidney-disease)
- [Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/gfr)
- [Assessing Kidney Function - Measured and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra054415)

**Tasks**: 
- Use [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to find a recent relevant article on eGFR formulas and CKD 
- MeSH terms:
    - "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"[Mesh]
    - "Glomerular Filtration Rate"[Mesh]
    - "Cohort Studies"[Mesh]
- Summarize the article in 3-5 sentences focusing on the goal of the study, how eGFR played a role, and key findings.
